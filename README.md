# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

PyBer is looking to improve access to ride sharing services and trying to determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. This analysis examines ride sharing data for three types of cities and looks for relationships between the type of city and number of riders and drivers. Preliminary results indicate that the urban cities generate more revenue while rural areas average more fare per ride. Recommendations are given for addressing these disparities.

## Results

The ride sharing data was aggregated by three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The data for each of these city types were explored in regard to total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The results are presented in the table below for January to April, 2019.

The table shows that the demand for rides is significantly higher in the urban cities than in the rural and suburban areas. The total number of rides in the urban area is more than twice the rural and suburban rides combined.  Consequently, the urban cities generate a significantly larger portion of the revenue. 

The total drivers in the urban cities outnumbers the demand for rides. This is not the case in the rural and suburban areas. In the rural areas, the ratio of total rides to drivers is 1.6:1. In the suburban cities, this ratio is 1.3: 1. While these two ratios are somewhat similar, the average fare per driver is significantly higher for the rural cities. 

Although the urban cities generate the largest total fares, when considering the average fare per ride, urban cities generate 26% less revenue than suburban cities and 41% less revenue than the rural cities. Increasing the total rides in the rural cities would increase overall revenue at a faster rate. Thus, the rides in the rural areas are likely to be more profitable than those in the urban cities. 

The total fares earned by city type is presented in the line chart below. The graph reinforces that that the urban cities generate the most revenue and reveal periods of increases and decreases for all city types during the time period. The urban cities seem to have more ups and down in March and April and the rural cities tend to have more ups and downs during the early months of the year. The suburban cities see an increase during April while the others see a small decrease. Interestingly, all types of cities see a peak during the month of February.
