# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

PyBer is looking to improve access to ride sharing services and trying to determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. This analysis examines ride sharing data for three types of cities and looks for relationships between the type of city and number of riders and drivers. Preliminary results indicate that the urban cities generate more revenue while rural areas average more fare per ride. Recommendations are given for addressing these disparities.
