# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

PyBer is looking to improve access to ride sharing services and trying to determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. This analysis examines ride sharing data for three types of cities and looks for relationships between the type of city and number of riders and drivers. Preliminary results indicate that the urban cities generate more revenue while rural areas average more fare per ride. Recommendations are given for addressing these disparities.

## Results

The ride sharing data was aggregated by three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The data for each of these city types were explored in regard to total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The results are presented in the table below for January to April, 2019.

The table shows that the demand for rides is significantly higher in the urban cities than in the rural and suburban areas. The total number of rides in the urban area is more than twice the rural and suburban rides combined.  Consequently, the urban cities generate a significantly larger portion of the revenue. 

The total drivers in the urban cities outnumbers the demand for rides. This is not the case in the rural and suburban areas. In the rural areas, the ratio of total rides to drivers is 1.6:1. In the suburban cities, this ratio is 1.3: 1. While these two ratios are somewhat similar, the average fare per driver is significantly higher for the rural cities. 

Although the urban cities generate the largest total fares, when considering the average fare per ride, urban cities generate 26% less revenue than suburban cities and 41% less revenue than the rural cities. The difference is even more drastic when inspecting the average fare per driver. The rural city drivers bring in more than three times the fare than the urban city drivers and about 1.4 times more than the suburban city drivers. Consequently, increasing the total rides in the rural cities would increase overall revenue at a faster rate. Thus, the rides in the rural areas are likely to be more profitable than those in the urban or suburban cities. 

The total fares earned by each city type is presented in the line chart below. The graph reinforces that the urban cities generate the most revenue and reveals periods of increases and decreases for all city types during the time period. The urban cities seem to have more ups and down in March and April and the rural cities tend to have more ups and downs during the early months of the year. The suburban cities see an increase during April while the others see a small decrease. Interestingly, all types of cities see a peak during the month of February.

## Summary

As this exploratory analysis revealed, disparities exist with regard to rides, drivers, and average fares among the three city types. Three recommendations  for addressing these disparities follow:

1. Further analysis on various demographics of customers such as gender and age might provide insight on who is and who is not utilizing PyBer services. In turn, this information could provide feedback for the marketing department to design potential marketing strategies for various audiences.  

2. Rural areas have the greatest potential to be the most profitable thus focusing on increasing services to the rural areas is wise. One contemplation might be to offer a type of rewards program for frequent use to attract repeat customers and entice those who have not yet utilized PyBer's services.

3. Additional analysis for the remainder of the year is needed to examine trends with regard to increases and decreases in total rides. Perhaps during times when total fares are decreasing, promotions for utilizing PyBer's servces  are offered to attract new customers.
